# To-Do
---
## Really Important Things
- [] Tidy `NumericalLoewner.F90` and refine comments
- [] Double check the `implicit none`'s 
- [] Differentiate between cubic and quadratic, forward and inverse, etc 
- [] Make sure style is consistent across files 
- [] Organise files into separate folders 
## Get Around To It
- [] Tidy `CubicLoewner.F90` and refine comments
- [] Enhance Matlab's float output for root-mean-squared files 
## Maybe 
- [] Overhaul interface/running script 
- [] Merge image scripts 
## Towards The End
- [] Replace this file with instructions for use, explanation of overall structure, etc (and describe this in report)

# Marking Scheme
---
## 1. Background, Aims and Organisation (25%)
* Student has understood project aims
* Student has _stated_ project aims
* There is a suitable literature review that relates to the task
* The project is well-organised with suitable sub-goals
## 2. Difficulty Level and Achievement (25%)
* Student has achieved all of the stated aims
* The project is complex and challenging
* The student has produced a considerable body of deliverables in terms of software and write-up
## 3. Clarity (25%)
* Report is written carefully
* The report has a clear structure with a flowing, logical argument
* It is easy to understand the core ideas of the project
## 4. Analysis and Testing (25%)
* Software-based projects:
    * There is thorough testing
    * There is an analysis of the strengths/weaknesses (of software or testing or both?)
    * There is **detailed documentation**
* Research-based projects:
    * There is critical analysis of method
    * There is a critical analysis of the results
    * Weaknesses and possible extensions are discussed

# Dissertation Talk (Highlights)

## Justification of Project
* The project findings are interesting and/or useful to a certain community of researchers (or will be in the future)
* Make motivation clear in preamble/thesis overview (marker can see why research is being pursued easily)
## Summary Section
##### Place summary at start of project to set work in perspective:
* What is known so far about the thing
* What attempts have there been to explain the thing
* How does project go beyond existing knowledge of the thing
## Introductory Chapter
* Clarify background to thesis
* Explain field-specific jargon so that it is accessible to non-specialist (this will be used to gauge understanding)
## Unique Contributions
* Clearly delineate own work from that which has been done before
* Make proper references to earlier work, including sources from which various figures or plots have been taken or adapted
## Conclusions/Summary
* Describe what has been achieved
* Compare own work to previous work
* Explain (briefly) implications of results (overlap with introductory sections is permissible)
## Future Work
* Explain what remains to be done
* Potential next steps
* Potential methodologies
## General Considerations
* Proof read and accuracy read
* Help the marker as much as possible, explain things, avoid cryptic sentences,
* Use appendices for further explanations and things that disrupt "flow" of work
